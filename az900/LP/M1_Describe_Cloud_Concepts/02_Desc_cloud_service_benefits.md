# 1.2) Describe Cloud Service Benefits

## Objectives:
	- Define Cloud Benefits of: 
		- High Availability; Scalability
		- Reliability & Predictability
		- Security & Governance
		- Manageability

## High Availability & Scalability
	- High Availability
		- Solution Architecting --> Consider Service availability guarantees
		- Uptime guarantees:
			- service-dependent
			- Part of SLAs
			- 100% - impractical --> 99%; 99.9%; 99.99...9%, etc.
				- Costly to get higher
	- Scalability 
		- Vertical (Up/Down): Increase/Decrease resource capabilities
			- Add/Subtract CPUs/RAM to VMs
		- Horizontal (In/Out): Add/Subtract Nr of Resources
			- Add/Take away extra VMs/Containers

## Reliability & Predictability
	- Reliability
	- Predictability
		- Performance
		- Cost

## Security & Governance
	- bla

## Manageability
	- bla
